- [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/)?
MQTT is an OASIS standard messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). It is designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices with a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth.

- [Eclipse Paho](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/)?
MQTT and MQTT-SN are lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transports for TCP/IP and connectionless protocols (such as UDP) respectively. The Eclipse Paho project provides open source, mainly client side, implementations of MQTT and MQTT-SN in a variety of programming languages.
